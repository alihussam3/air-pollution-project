## Introduction

This dashboard was created for engineers , weather forecast and companies to gain a specific information about the air pollution in the world  is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2024 (including countries , cities , and the aqi value), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compensation. 

## Skills Showcased

- **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `aqi value ` and `city count `.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line** to compare polltants level and track trends .
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of pollutants.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by pollutnts type .
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
